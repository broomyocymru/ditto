1. The same thing again.
1.1 Used to indicate that something already said is applicable a second time.

Ditto is a boilerplate CLI framework written in Python, making it easy to repeat tasks.
Its aim is provide the platform to allow teams to quickly use and share automation scripts and common CLI commands in a useful self documenting style.
